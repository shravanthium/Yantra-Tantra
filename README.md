###Problem 1: Warmup Stats
Given an array of N integers separated by spaces, all in one line.

Display the following:

Mean (m): The average of all the integers.

Median of this array: In case, the number of integers is odd, the middle element; else, the average of the middle two elements.

Mode: The element(s) which occurs most frequently. If multiple elements satisfy this criteria, display the numerically smallest one.

Standard Deviation (SD).

SD = (((x1-m)2+(x2-m)2+(x3-m)2+(x4-m)2+...(xN-m)2))/N)0.5

where xi is the ith element of the array

Lower and Upper Boundary of the 95% Confidence Interval for the mean, separated by a space.
